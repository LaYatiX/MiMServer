# Three-Phase Electric Power Analyser - Internet of Things

In this project we've created a gizmo which can gather data from a Three-Phase Electric Power. The input is then displayed in a form of the graphs (linear chart shows a value of each of the phase's voltage). A user can then track any occuring interference and set specific elements accordingly in order to compensate examined device. This can be achieved via switching certain buttons on the page.

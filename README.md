# Three-Phase Electric Power Analyser - Internet of Things

In this project we've created a gizmo which can gather data from a Three-Phase Electric Power. The input is then displayed in a form of the graphs (linear chart shows a value of each of the phase's voltage). A user can then track any occuring interference and set specific elements accordingly in order to compensate examined device. This can be achieved via switching certain buttons on the page.

This website is fully **responsive**, uses **CSS Grid** and includes **SVG** elements. The linear chart was created using **d3v4** library.
